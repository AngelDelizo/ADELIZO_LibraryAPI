# Library API

The **Library API** is a RESTful library system management service. It includes functionalities for managing users, authors, books, and the relationships between books and authors. This API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and supports complete CRUD operations.

## Features
- **RESTful Architecture**: Supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the API with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Token Revocation**: Ensures tokens are valid for only one use, enhancing security.
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage users, authors, book, and book-author relationships.
- **Token Lifecycle Management**: Prevent token reuse for enhanced security.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Backend language.
- **Slim Framework**: For building the API structure.
- **Firebase JWT Library**: For token generation and validation.
- **Composer**: Dependency management.
- **MySQL**:
  - Relational database to store user, author, book, and relationship data.
  - Structured with normalized tables for efficient queries.
  - Ensures data integrity with primary/foreign keys and constraints.

## Authentication

### Overview

The API uses JWT for authenticating requests. Upon login, users receive a token that must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.

### Token Management

- Each token is unique and stored temporarily.
- Tokens are validated and checked for reuse.
- Expired or reused tokens will result in an authentication failure.
  
### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with valid credentials.
2. API returns a JWT.
3. The user includes the token in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`) for subsequent requests.
4. API validates the token before processing requests.
